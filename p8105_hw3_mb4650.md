# Problem 1

Load instacart dataset.

``` r
data(instacart)
```

The dataset comes from the Instacart online grocery service. It includes
1384617 observations for 15 variables. These variables include the
order, user, and product ID. There is also information about the order
products were added to the cart, if the products were ordered by the
user before, as well as when the order was placed. Information regarding
the product, including the name, what aisle it is on, and what
department it is in. Each observation in the dataset includes this
information for one order for a given user.

How many aisles and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>%
count(aisle) %>%
arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # â€¦ with 124 more rows

Make a plot\!

``` r
instacart %>%
count(aisle) %>%
filter(n > 10000) %>%
mutate(
aisle = factor(aisle),
aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
geom_point() +
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Table of three most popular items in given aisles.

``` r
instacart %>%
filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
group_by(aisle) %>%
count(product_name) %>%
mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>%
filter(rank < 4) %>%
arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Table mean time Apples and Ice Cream were ordered.

``` r
instacart %>%
filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
pivot_wider(
names_from = order_dow,
values_from = mean_hour
)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

Load and tidy accel data.

``` r
accel_tidy_data =
  read_csv(
    "./accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity_count")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset includes 50400 observations and `ncol(accel_tidy_data)`
variables. The variables include information on what week and day the
data is from, the day id, the minute of the day the activity was taking
place, as well as the count of the activity taking place in that minute.

Table total activity for day.

``` r
accel_tidy_data %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_count))%>%
  arrange(desc(total_activity))
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 7 x 2
    ##   day       total_activity
    ##   <chr>              <dbl>
    ## 1 Friday          2291711.
    ## 2 Wednesday       2129772.
    ## 3 Thursday        2091151.
    ## 4 Sunday          1919213 
    ## 5 Monday          1858699.
    ## 6 Tuesday         1799238.
    ## 7 Saturday        1369237

From the output, I do not notice any trends in the total activity
counts.

``` r
accel_tidy_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = activity_count )) +
geom_point(aes(color = day)) 
```
